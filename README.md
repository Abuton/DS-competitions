# DS-competitions
House for my DS competition codes Starting from January. Still Competing and improving the model performance

I have been able to practice Clustering techinuques using KMeans and PCA methods to improve model performance
additional feature engineering didn't work out well but we'll keep pushing 

Decided to add some of my datacamp guided projects to the repository

Also added some script file for automation of tasks like creating cross validations folds, plotting etc
